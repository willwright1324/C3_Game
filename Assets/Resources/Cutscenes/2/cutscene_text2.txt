There was once a village in a far away galaxy.
The Great Color Cube residing in the planet's core had provided color to the land for eons.
One day a strange portal appeared, disrupting the peace of the village.
A mischievous alien of shadow emerged! And he did not look friendly.
The alien blasted a hole through the planet with immense power.
The Great Color Cube was not strong enough...
With the planet's color gone, the shadow alien could feast on the doom and gloom of the people.
The Cube was broken, but all hope was not lost.
It was up to one brave villager to restore the cubes power, and defeat the shadow alien...
